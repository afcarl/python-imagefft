# python-imagefft

Numerical experiment to investigate sunstars for camera lenses with different number of aperture blades. Typically, Nikon lenses have an odd number and Canon lenses have an even number. 

An odd number of aperture blades leads two twice as many rays (one for each kink in the aperture). An even number leads to the same number because of symmetry, which causes the rays to become degenerate.
